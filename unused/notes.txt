/* user has to fill out a form capturing drive time, neighborhood, and base before seeing the military discounts.
/* need to put in javascript validation to ensure they finish the form before seeing discounts.
/	* use jquery validate and have the submit button (and window clear button) disabled until
/		all fields are filled in
* then need to build the google maps overlay.
/	* have a polygon for Daniel Island
/	* will probably need a more precise polygon for each neighborhood (get it from polygon generator website)
/	* want to store the coordinate sets somewhere else (probably attach them to the neighborhood model)

/ need to generalize the coordinate sets being built, starting with one city, then mapping each neighborhood, then mapping each duty station

 check Hartl's book for making random users

google maps overlay will be this:
/* one overlay of just neighborhoods (this will be a set of polygons)
* another overlay of bases and their gate locations: blue for in/out, green for in only, red for out only
	* will need to deselect bases using a check box
/* another overlay of users and their drive times; this will be a "heat map" showing relative density,
/	and then a range of drive times showing the middle 50% of responses from that neighborhood to a specific base
/* need to create a ruby function that calculates the range of drive times
/	-- take the array of users who live in that neighborhood
/	-- build an array of drive times to the first base
/	-- have a section in the info window for each city's duty station

* add "likes" to neighborhoods, places, etc

* javascript functions:
1. build an array of neighborhoods-- they each have a name and a set of borders and maybe a fill color
2. build an array of bases from the Rails model -- each has a set of borders, fill color, and
	an array of gate locations by GPS (might need a new model to attach to the bases)
3. an array of users containing rank, neighborhood, duty station, drive time, and pictures?
	can only see pictures or other data if logged in
	
	
Finally, a Q&A section.
* users must have a reputation score, incremented when:
	1. they ask a question
	2. they answer a question
	3. someone likes their question
	4. someone likes their answer
	5. sign up
