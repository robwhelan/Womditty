	<p><%= image_tag('robwhelan.jpg', :width => 150, :class => 'img-responsive') %> When I was a submariner, I moved six times in five years, to brand new cities. I wish I had insider knowledge to help get settled.</p>
	<p>I launched Womditty ('Word of Mouth, Do it Yourself') so we can help the thousands of sailors and airmen and their families moving to Charleston every year. Already there are <strong><%= @count %></strong> inbound military folks on Womditty looking for advice.</p>
	<p>Just log in and share a tidbit about the area - your favorite things to do, the traffic, places to avoid, must-sees, pet stuff, kid stuff. Trust me, every little bit helps!</p>
	<p>Thanks! <em>Rob Whelan, founder</em></p>
